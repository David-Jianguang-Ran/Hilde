Django Channels + React.js webapp template

Hi! This is a web-app template build with Django-Channels and React.js!
All the settings and configs are included, ideally it's a plug-n-play template

A few quick tips:

  The commands needed to start the server is in notes.txt
  
  Add a config.py file before running server/worker. config.py should contain a 50 char secret_key
  charset=[abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*(-_=+)]
  
  Redis-server MUST BE installed in order for the channel_layers to work!
  
Enjoy!
